# tdd-node-backend
Project to learn a bit about tdd with jest.

This project was my first contact with jest, through the rocketseat's video [take a look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2G_mWfG0DZE10).

# Run it

2. Add dependencies:
```cmd
  yarn
```
3. Run tests:
```cmd
  yarn test
 ```
4. Start the server (not required to test)

4.1 Run the migrations

  yarn sequelize db:migrate
```
4.2 Start server

```
